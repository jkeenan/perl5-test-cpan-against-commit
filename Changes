Revision history for Perl module Test::Against::Dev

0.11 Mon Jul 16 11:58:54 EDT 2018
    - Correct error in Test::Against::Dev::ProcessPSV::read_one_psv().

0.10 Sun Jul 15 21:23:52 EDT 2018
    - Introduce Test::Against::Dev::ProcessPSV.  This package provides methods
      to consolidate monthly PSV files into the master PSV file as it grows
      from one monthly dev release to the next.  t/007-process-ppv.t exercises
      these methods.

    - Add helper program scripts/unpack-log-json-gz.  This program can be used
      to properly unpack the tarball of .log.json files created by method
      analyze_json_logs() in each of Test::Against::Dev and Test::Against::Build.

    - The tarball file created by analyze_json_logs() now defaults to
      extension '.tar.gz' rather than simply '.gz'.  This better describes the
      fact that the file is a gzipped tar file of '.json.log' files.

    - For consistency, all .pm and .t files now 'use 5.14.0'.

    - t/005-tab-new.t has been renamed t/005-test-against-build.t.  This
      better documents what it actually tests.

0.09 Thu Jul 12 22:02:13 EDT 2018
    - Introduce Test::Against::Build.  Whereas Test::Against::Dev assesses
      the impact of monthly development releases -- and now also RC releases
      -- on selected sets of modules (e.g., the top of the CPAN river),
      Test::Against::Build assesses the impact of individual commits to the
      repository.  It should be particularly useful in measuring changes in
      impact between two specific commits.

    - Introduce Test::Against::Dev::Sort.  Provides methods for validating and
      sorting lists of perl version strings.

0.08 Tue Apr  3 11:55:09 EDT 2018
    - Correct some errors in test files.  No functional changes.
