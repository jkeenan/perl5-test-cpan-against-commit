TODO list for Perl module Test::Against::Dev

2017-12-11: configure_build_install_perl() currently only supports 'gz' decompression.
Extend it to 'bz2' and xz'.

Figure out why I couldn't get ... -MList::Compare -e 'print $List::Compare::VERSION' 
to work.  DONE: 2017-12-11 22:01

2017-12-12: The temporary directories and files I'm using in the first part of
t/004 can probably be generated under a true tempdir by use of a test helper
module.
