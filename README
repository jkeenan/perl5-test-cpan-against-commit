README for Perl extension Test::Against::Dev

This library should be used by anyone who wishes to assess the impact of
month-to-month changes in the Perl 5 core distribution on the installability
of libraries found on the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network (CPAN).

You should be able to install this library by a CPAN installer such as 'cpan'
or 'cpanm'.  Such installers will automatically install the prerequisite
libraries listed in Makefile.PL.

At the very least you should be able to use this set of instructions
to install the module:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

This library has not yet been adapted for use on Windows.
